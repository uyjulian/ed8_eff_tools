ED8 Effect File Tools
=====================

This repository contains tools to convert between ``.eff`` binary files and a readable and editable JSON format.  

The tools are compatible with the PC versions of ED8, ED82, ED83, ED84, and ED85 games.  

The tools are provided for research purposes, and are barely documented.  
As such, please send patches to improve the tools (e.g. improving labeling, adding features, or adding documentation).

Modding help and resources
==========================

See `Trails Research Group
<https://github.com/Trails-Research-Group>`_ for more resources to assist in modding the game.
